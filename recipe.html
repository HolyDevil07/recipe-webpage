  <!-- Hello Mr AbiolaðŸš€, I appreciate your effort in trying to submit this assignment. Welldone so much sirðŸš€
However, there are some things I will like you to note
1)You are putting tags like h1, ul and p in the head tag, these tags are meant to be in the body tag. Pls fix this at 
you earliest convenience
2)What I am seeing in the browser is nothing like what is in the mockup, pls try and work on this as soon as you can
Again I really appreciate your effort in trying to do this assignment, but this is not what I have asked you to do sir. If you have any specific questions you do like to ask please feel free to reach out to me or any of the members of the class -->
